## StdIO.jack
A library of functions for textual input and output over UART.

### 	function void printString(String s)
Print the String s to UART_TX and disposes the String s.
### function void printInt(int i)
Prints the decimal representation of i to UART_TX
### function void println()
Prints the new line character to UART_TX
### function int readInt(String message)
Displays the message on the screen, disposes the message, reads from UART_RX the entered text until a newline character is detected, echoes the text to UART_TX, and returns its integer value (until the first non-digit character in the entered text is detected). Also handles user backspaces.
### function String readLine(String message)
Sends the message to UART_TX, reads from UART_RX the entered text until a newline character is detected, echoes the text to the UART_TX, and returns its value. Also handles user backspaces.

## Project
* Implement `StdIO.jack`.
* Run String_Test in real hardware on iCE40HX1K-EVB using a terminal program connected to UART.

* Compare your terminal output with:

```
StdIO test:
Please press the number '3': 
ok
readLine test:
(Verify echo and usage of 'backspace')
Please type 'JACK' and press enter: JACK
ok
readInt test:
(Verify echo and usage of 'backspace')
Please type '-32123' and press enter: -32123
ok

Test completed successfully
