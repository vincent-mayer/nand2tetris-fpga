# 3D printed case

Finally we print case with a 3d-Printer. All the parts are modelled with free software tools.

- [blender](https://blender.org) is a very powerfull 3D modelling software. All parts of the cube are modelled with blender. You can edit the blender files and change details on the design. The blender-design files can than be exported to STL-format, a common 3D-file format used for 3D-printing.
- [prusa-slic3r](https://www.prusa3d.com). This is the slicer software for 3D-Printers from the manufacturer Prusa. This programm is used to convert the STL-files to printerspecific gcode-files.

The subfolder `files/` containes the blender files, the corresponging STL-files and the already sliced gcodes for Prusa-MK3S printer.

On the rear cover you see connectors for power supply (5V), RJ45 Ethernet connector and the USB connector which has dual usage:
1. upload bitstream files to iCE40 fpga
2. communicate to Hack-Computer over UART
